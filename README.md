# Machine-Learning-Task

Machine Learning Project
This repository contains Python code and resources for various machine learning tasks, including data cleaning, logistic regression, anomaly detection, image classification using CNN, and time series forecasting.

Files
Data Preprocessing :
This script provides functions for preprocessing and cleaning raw data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing feature scaling.
Logistic Regression from scratch :
This script implements logistic regression from scratch. It includes functions for sigmoid function, log loss.
Anomaly Detection: Here, you'll find an implementation of an anomaly detection from scratch. The script identifies anomalies in a dataset based on deviations from a normal distribution.
Image Classification using CNN:

Time Series Forecasting:
time_series_forecasting.py: This script contains code for performing time series forecasting using techniques like ARIMA ,ARMA , SARIMA.
